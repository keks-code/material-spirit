# Material Spirit

Material Spirit is a SCSS/CSS library designed to compliment Angular Material and MDC-Web. It contains utilities I miss in those frameworks and some additional components.

The library has no dependecy on the mentioned frameworks. It just doesn't repeat things that are already available on those frameworks.

## Design considerations

1. The library is designed to be used via `@use`, not `@import`.
2. It has modular structure so you can use any subset of modules.
3. 




## Usage
